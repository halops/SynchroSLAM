# SynchroSLAM

## Abstract
We present SynchroSLAM: a loosely coupled multi-modal SLAM approach for synchronized LiDAR-Visual-Inertial (LVI) systems. Our system integrates pose measurements from two different tightly coupled odometry systems, Visual-Inertial (VI) and LiDAR-Inertial (LI). These are loosely coupled by means of a pose graph representation that enables a robust late-fusion of pose measurements, being resilient to geometric and visual degeneracy. The developed multi-modal feature extraction allows the global optimization system to reduce long term localization errors via loop closure, achieving state of the art performance on public LVI datasets.
Our method has also been deployed on a custom robotics platform. We developed a simple and reproducible hardware synchronization system using commercial-off-the-shelf hardware, and it is made publicly available at https://halops.github.io/SynchroSLAM/.
