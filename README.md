# SynchroSem

## Abstract
We present SynchroSem: a loosely coupled multi-modal semantic SLAM approach for synchronized Lidar-Visual-Inertial (LVI) systems. Our system integrates pose measurements from two different tightly coupled odometry systems, Visual-Inertial (VI) and Lidar-Inertial (LI). These are loosely coupled by means of a pose graph representation that enables a robust late-fusion of measurements, being resilient to geometric and visual degeneracy. The developed multi-modal semantic feature extraction allows the global optimization system to reduce long term operation errors via loop closure. Our approach achieves State-of-the-Art performance on public Lidar-Visual-Inertial (LVI) datasets, while also being deployed on a custom robotics platform.
A simple and reproducible hardware synchronization system using commercial-off-the-shelf hardware has been implemented and is made publicly available at https://sinchrosem.github.io.
